# Deploying to Vercel

This guide walks you through deploying your Next.js portfolio to Vercel.

## Why Vercel?

Vercel is the company behind Next.js and offers:
- **Automatic deployments** on every push to main
- **Zero configuration** - detects Next.js automatically
- **Global CDN** for fast page loads worldwide
- **Preview deployments** for pull requests
- **Built-in analytics** and performance monitoring
- **Free tier** for personal projects

## Prerequisites

- GitHub account with your portfolio repository
- Vercel account (free at https://vercel.com)

## Step-by-Step Deployment

### 1. Push Your Code to GitHub

Make sure all your changes are committed and pushed:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Migrate to Next.js 15"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Import to Vercel

1. Go to https://vercel.com and sign in (or create an account)
2. Click "Add New..." â†’ "Project"
3. Import your GitHub repository
4. Vercel will automatically detect Next.js settings

### 3. Configure Environment Variables

Before deploying, add your environment variable:

1. In the Vercel project settings, go to "Environment Variables"
2. Add:
   - **Key**: `NEXT_PUBLIC_OPENWEATHER_API_KEY`
   - **Value**: Your OpenWeather API key
   - **Environment**: Production, Preview, Development (select all)

### 4. Deploy

Click "Deploy" and Vercel will:
- Install dependencies (`npm install`)
- Build your Next.js app (`npm run build`)
- Deploy to a global CDN
- Provide you with a deployment URL (e.g., `your-portfolio.vercel.app`)

### 5. Custom Domain Setup

To use your custom domain (yamin.com.au):

1. In your Vercel project, go to "Settings" â†’ "Domains"
2. Add your custom domain: `yamin.com.au`
3. Vercel will provide DNS records to add to your domain registrar:
   - **A Record**: Point to Vercel's IP (usually `76.76.21.21`)
   - **CNAME Record**: `www` pointing to `cname.vercel-dns.com`

4. Update your DNS settings at your domain registrar
5. Wait for DNS propagation (can take up to 48 hours, usually much faster)
6. Vercel will automatically provision an SSL certificate

### 6. Automatic Deployments

From now on, every push to your `main` branch will trigger a new deployment automatically!

## Deployment Settings

Vercel auto-detects these settings for Next.js:

- **Framework Preset**: Next.js
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `.next`
- **Install Command**: `npm install`
- **Node Version**: 18.x (or latest LTS)

You don't need to configure these unless you want custom settings.

## Preview Deployments

Every pull request gets its own preview URL so you can test changes before merging to production. This is perfect for testing new features!

## Monitoring & Analytics

Vercel provides built-in:
- **Real-time logs** for debugging
- **Performance analytics** (Core Web Vitals)
- **Function metrics** if you add API routes later

## Environment Variables for Different Environments

You can set different values for:
- **Production**: Live site (yamin.com.au)
- **Preview**: Pull request previews
- **Development**: Local development

## Troubleshooting

### Build Failures

If your build fails:
1. Check the build logs in Vercel dashboard
2. Verify all dependencies are in `package.json`
3. Test the build locally: `npm run build`

### Environment Variables Not Working

- Make sure variable names start with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` for client-side access
- Redeploy after adding new environment variables
- Check the variable is available in all environments (Production, Preview, Development)

### Custom Domain Not Working

- Verify DNS records are correct in your domain registrar
- Wait for DNS propagation (check with https://dnschecker.org)
- Ensure Vercel domain status shows "Valid Configuration"

## Rollback

If something goes wrong:
1. Go to "Deployments" in your Vercel dashboard
2. Find a previous working deployment
3. Click the three dots â†’ "Promote to Production"

## Cost

The free Vercel tier includes:
- Unlimited projects
- Unlimited deployments
- 100GB bandwidth per month
- Custom domains with SSL
- Preview deployments

This is more than enough for a personal portfolio!

## Next Steps

After deploying:

1. âœ… Test your live site at the Vercel URL
2. âœ… Configure your custom domain
3. âœ… Set up analytics (optional)
4. âœ… Remove old cPanel deployment if desired
5. âœ… Update your DNS to point to Vercel
