          I'm working in insurance technology, integrating LLM solutions into development
          workflows and improving insurtech offerings, while pursuing a Masters of IT
          (AI and Cybersecurity) at UNSW. I bridge the gap between developers and clients,
          turning technical possibilities into practical solutions.
        </p>

          My background spans engineering consulting and project management across
          infrastructure projects - water systems, roads, dams, and sustainability
          initiatives. I'm bringing those problem-solving principles from the physical
          world into SaaS and digital spaces. I love the complete lifecycle - from
          scoping and understanding pain points to delivering solutions that solve real problems.
        </p>
        <p>
          My approach focuses on aligning the right people, asking the right questions,
          and building solutions that actually work. That design thinking from my
          engineering and architecture studies shapes how I create digital experiences.
          Outside work, I spend time travelling, experimenting with caf√©-style drinks
          at home, baking, and illustrating.
