# GitHub Workflows

## Current Status

This portfolio is now deployed via **Vercel** instead of GitHub Actions.

Vercel automatically handles:
- Building on every push to main
- Preview deployments for pull requests
- SSL certificates
- Global CDN distribution

## Previous Deployment

The old Vite + cPanel/FTP workflow has been removed as the project has been migrated to Next.js 15.

## Setting Up Vercel

See the root `VERCEL_DEPLOYMENT.md` file for complete deployment instructions.
